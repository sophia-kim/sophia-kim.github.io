Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.
## Why Be Smart?
We all grew up listening to teachers saying, "there is no such thing as stupid questions." Well, throughout my years in high school and college, I have realized that there in fact are some questions that should be categorized as stupid or unnecessary. For instance, I had some people ask the same question that was answered a few seconds ago, or raise their hand confidently just to ask a question that could have been answered by doing some research on their own (I believe we all encountered at least one person like that... or we once were one of them too). Not paying attention or being lazy can lead to wasting everyone's time, and thay's why it's important to ask smart questions. At the end of the day, no one likes to endure endless series of questions for someone who is not competent enough to do the work for him or herself, especially in the world of programming; we all have our own projects to finish in a given period of time, our own codes to debug and our newly-introduced knowledge to digest. Time is gold and as much as we would like to help others in need, if they don't want to help themselves, it simply isn't worth our time. Thus, it is important that one must know and understand the methods of asking smart questions and apply them in real life so that he or she receives an efficient and effective answer whilst not wasting anyone's time.

## Example of a Bad Question

I visit StackOverflow every now and then to get an idea of a way to solve the problems I'm having but I had not realized that there were so many qustions that weren't asked in the smart way. I was browing through the huge pool of questions on StackOverflow and found pages of questions that were simply different phrases that contained the same meaning, "I don't even know what I don't know, fix my code by tonight, thanks." A good example of questions asked in not smart way is provided in the following url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1323830/relations-on-sets-homework . The user states, "This is my homework question; I dont know what to do" and provides the homework problem they were assigned. From my previous experiences with Discrete Mathematics, if they were assigned the homework problem, they should also have been provided a textbook which explains the concepts applied in the homework problem. In short, there is no way that they absolutely don't know what to do with the homework problems. This fails to fulfill the precepts for smart questions, as the title doesn't clearly reflect the issue the user was having, the user posted a homework question (and stated that it was their homework problem), the user wasn't precise in describing the issues he or she was having (did they not understand the concept of relations? Did they not know how to represent the answer in a set of ordered pairs?), and it did not seem like the user even attempted to solve the problem without proceeding to StackOverflow to fish for an answer. One of the responses was polite and nice enough to guide the user into understanding the topic and solving the problem on their own, but the other response read "just do what it says." Inefficient and ineffective way of asking questions clearly results in lack of enthusiasm in replies as they are not thrilled by a newbie who's motivated to learn anything and everything, and occasional harsh words thrown at you for being incompetent.
