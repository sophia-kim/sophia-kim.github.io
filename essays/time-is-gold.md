## Why Be Smart?
We all grew up listening to teachers saying, "there is no such thing as stupid questions." Well, throughout my years of high school and college, I have realized that there in fact are some questions that should be categorized as stupid or unnecessary. For instance, I had some people ask the same question that was answered a few seconds ago, or raise their hand confidently just to ask a question that could have been answered by doing some research on their own (I believe we all encountered at least one person like that... or we once were one of them too). Not paying attention or being lazy can lead to wasting everyone's time, and thay's why it's important to ask smart questions. At the end of the day, no one likes to endure endless series of questions for someone who is not competent enough to do the work for him or herself, especially in the world of programming; we all have our own projects to finish in a given period of time, our own codes to debug and our newly-introduced knowledge to digest. Time is gold and as much as we would like to help others in need, if they don't want to help themselves, it simply isn't worth our time. Thus, it is important that one must know and understand the methods of asking smart questions and apply them in real life so that he or she receives an efficient and effective answer whilst not wasting anyone's time.

## Example of a Bad Question

I visit StackOverflow every now and then to get an idea of a way to solve the problems I'm having but I had not realized that there were so many qustions that weren't asked in the smart way. I was browing through the huge pool of questions on StackOverflow and found pages of questions that were simply different phrases that contained the same meaning, "I don't even know what I don't know, fix my code by tonight, thanks." A good example of questions asked in not smart way is provided in the following url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1323830/relations-on-sets-homework . The user states, "This is my homework question; I dont know what to do" and provides the homework problem they were assigned. From my previous experiences with Discrete Mathematics, if they were assigned the homework problem, they should also have been provided a textbook which explains the concepts applied in the homework problem. In short, there is no way that they absolutely don't know what to do with the homework problems. This fails to fulfill the precepts for smart questions, as the title doesn't clearly reflect the issue the user was having, the user posted a homework question (and stated that it was their homework problem), the user wasn't precise in describing the issues he or she was having (did they not understand the concept of relations? Did they not know how to represent the answer in a set of ordered pairs?), and it did not seem like the user even attempted to solve the problem without proceeding to StackOverflow to fish for an answer. One of the responses was polite and nice enough to guide the user into understanding the topic and solving the problem on their own, but the other response read "just do what it says." Inefficient and ineffective way of asking questions clearly results in lack of enthusiasm in replies as they are not thrilled by a newbie who's not motivated to broaden their knowledge, and occasional harsh words thrown at you for being incompetent.

## Example of a Good Question

Through the dark tunnel filled with "questions" which were really "do my homework" in disguise, I was able to find some questions that were asked in the smart way and, consequently, obtained smart answers. An example of such questions can be found in the following url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048 . The user had encountered the famous mobile game 2048 and wanted to write a program to follow a well-defined strategy to win the game. The user stated what he came up with so far, how he thought it was going to work out and what the actual outcome of his trial was. He included a short algorithm that sums up his strategy and proceeds to ask if there was an optimal algorithm for the game. Clearly, when compared with the "not smart" question example above, the question is effective; the user actually takes his time to explain what the game is about, how he planned to approach it and opened room for suggestions from other users. Although this specific question may not be the epitome of a smart question, it was organized well enough to draw attentions of many professionals who actually developed the game's AI. The people who replied to this thread provided profound details regarding the breakdown of the program and its algorithm. The great replies and enthusiam the thread carried didn't surprise me, as the user who had origianlly asked the question seemed to be willing to learn and improve and wasn't just looking for some direct answers that would solve his problem. 

## Through This Experience

Reading the article "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond showed me new means of an effective communication skills, which are most ideal for both the questioner and the respondent. It is interesting how just reading something changes your perspective entirely; the questions on StackOverflow that would not have bothered me before started to catch my eyes. I also find it interesting that there are so many questions that are similar, if not the same, to each other online. It really doesn't take that long to type out your error or the issues you're having on Google PRIOR to going to StackOverflow and posting a new question with the title that reads, "HOMEWORK HELP NEEDED!" This experience was an eye-opening assignment as I looked back at my actions the past years and thought of the incidents where I had asked not smart questions, deeply regret what I have done and all the times I have wasted and decided to think twice before asking a question.
