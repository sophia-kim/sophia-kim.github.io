For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by electronic devices and their underlying mechanics. I wanted to have the ability to create innovative solutions to the problems around me. From my academic endeavors, I narrowed down the topic that interests me the most to Computer Science. I was enticed by the euphoria that I experienced from being able to create a functional algorithm from a purely theoretical concept that I learned about online. Of course, being a computer science major was far more challenging than I had anticipated; it was so much more than just simply coding. Throwing myself into a field like computer science meant more critical thinking, effective communication skills, problem solving, and a strong mentality. Despite all the obstables that I have encountered on this journey so far, I truly feel that it is something that I want to pursue and improve on.

## Entering the Scary World

Jumping into this field without a solid understanding and background in computer science, I soon realized that I lacked a lot of skills that this discipline requires. For instance, I did not expect to face a tall mountain called discrete mathematics my first semester in college. Discrete mathematics, in my opinion, is a very intricate subject that demands great problem solving skills, critical thinking and time management (and possibly some quality time spent on contemplating life). Time management is especailly crucial, as the time is strictly limited and balancing multiple courses as well as working part-time can be extremely exhausting. Over time, I began developing these skills that were necessary to succeed in the course, but I know that I still have a lot of room for improvements (there is always room for improvements). In the future, I hope to strengthen my skills involving problem solving, critical thinking and time management to better my performance in academics so that it can assist me when I enter the "real world". 

It has not been that long since I started to devote my time into the world of programming and computer science, and I have seen many people my age and even younger develop bigger projects than I have ever done so far. Over the course of time and by taking many classes offered at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I hope to be experienced enough to develop larger-scale software engineering projects that could help others. I want to be familiar with numerous programming languages and have concrete understanding of this field rather than just grasping on basic concepts to broaden my knowledge within this field. It may appear that there are a lot of things on my plate at the moment, but I strongly believe that being eager to fail and learn will eventually lead me to the place I want to be at.
