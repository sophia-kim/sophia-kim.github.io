UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

  It all began on a hot summer night a year ago. I was comfortably attached to my bed like always, doing absolutely nothing but breathing... until my father decided to lecture me for a good hour or so out of nowhere, asking about my career plans, how I plan on making billions of dollars in one day, and many other things that parents would ask their children. I told him I didn't have any specific plans, and that I was still unsure of which field of computer science I wanted to dive into. He raised his voice a bit, probably out of frustration that his daughter didn't have any goals. Then he decided to give me a project that scarred me for life; building a website for his business. Of course, his intention was good and pure, he just wanted me to explore new things and find something that interests me so I can do something with my life instead of just sitting around all day. However, building a website was so much more than what I expected as a newbie in the world of computer science. Nonetheless, I knew I would much rather build a website than sit through another hour long lecture with my dad. I watched tutorials on Youtube all day, slept through some of the videos, and finally felt confident enough to start building this website for my father! 
  
  **Except I felt like I belonged in the Stone Age.**
  
  Living in the world where new phones come out every few months, have items shipped to your house with just a few clicks and cars that know when to brake and gas, the website I built seemed a little __too__ out of the picture. It wasn't clear what the website was even made for, and it almost even looked like a scam. In short, it didn't look appealing at all. My father asked me to update him on the project so I showed him a glimpse of the horrendous "website," and as hard as he tried to hide what he was feeling inside, I could tell that he was almost shocked to see my creation. He stopped asking me for updates, I stopped caring for building a website, I started school and no longer was sitting around, my father didn't lecture me anymore, and all was good. I never thought I would encounter HTML again, which was a dumb thought considering how I am a computer science major; I could never escape it even if I tried.

  The beginning of the rollercoaster ride was something I was already familiar with; although I had buried it deep inside of me, I still remembered the basic HTML and CSS well enough to complete the assignments and the WOD. As we changed gear and started heading up, we were introduced to the world of Semantic UI
