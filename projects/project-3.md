The National Honor Society at the high school that I attended was fairly small, consisting of approximately 18 people. And all of us had the same goal while being apart of the National Honor Society; giving back to the school and the community. We always thought of possible volunteer activities that we could do to help the students in school and any community member. Our activities ranged from helping out at the library and teachers' classrooms during our breaks to participating in events involving bigger organizations such as the Heart Walk. After a while, realizing we haven't done anything to help our peers, we decided to open tutoring sessions to anyone in any grade who needs help with their classes. When students came in with their assignments or test materials to receive help from the members of NHS, we were required to sit down with the students for a good amount of time to help them comprehend the material and the subject better. 

At times, it was challenging for me to help others with certain classes as I had my weak subjects, but I had always tried my best to help the students, even if it took a while. What I learned from this experience of helping others is that knowledge is such a powerful thing. It's not tangible, it's not something you can touch or feel but it is something you can share and exchange. And I found the beauty in that, seeing people eager to learn and improve, both the tutor and the student. I was tutoring the students who needed help with their classes, but I learned more from the students who constantly came in to receive help than they probably had learned from me. I believe this experience is what sparked my interest in helping people, and I plan on continuing on with this passion further, starting with tutoring students at the Learning Assistance Center at Sinclair Library.
